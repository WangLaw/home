		<h2 id = "Original Definition"> Actual Definition and Origins </h2>
		<p> <a href = "https://www.etymonline.com/word/ratio">Ratio </a> first originated in the 1630s, being derived from the Latin word &ldquo;ratio&rdquo;. At the time, it meant reason or rationale.
		The more commonly accepted mathematical definition which measures the number of times one number is contained in another was first adopted in the 1950s. </p>

	    <p> Today, ratio is used on social media sites like twitter as a responsive message. 
		For example, a celebrity or authority figure may have a bad take on a certain topic or subject. 
		Another user will reply with something along the lines of &ldquo;ratio&rdquo; or &ldquo;.&rdquo; 
		If that comments receives more likes, retweets, shares etc., than the original poster (celebrity/authority figure), then it shows that the celebrity had a bad take. </p>
